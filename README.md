# Qantas Loyalty Style Guides

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

"Style" covers a lot of ground, from "use camelCase for variable names" to
"never use global variables" to "never use exceptions."" This project links to the
style guidelines we use for Qantas Loyalty code.

This project is largely based on ([google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)).

This project currently only holds the [Java Style Guide][java]. It is hoped that other
developers will help to extend this to cover other languages such as Javascript, HTML/CSS
and golang.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the [XML
Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual style
rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.
